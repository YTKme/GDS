       "\"Sophie, oh Sophie, your time has come. My granddaughter, Violet is 5 months old and starting to teeth. What joy little Sophie brings to Violet. Sophie is made of a very pliable rubber that is sturdy but not tough. It is quite easy for Violet to twist Sophie into unheard of positions to get Sophie into her mouth. The little nose and hooves fit perfectly into small mouths, and the drooling has purpose. The paint on Sophie is food quality.Sophie was born in 1961 in France. The maker had wondered why there was nothing available for babies and made Sophie from the finest rubber, phthalate-free on St Sophie's Day, thus the name was born. Since that time millions of Sophie's populate the world. She is soft and for babies little hands easy to grasp. Violet especially loves the bumpy head and horns of Sophie. Sophie has a long neck that easy to grasp and twist. She has lovely, sizable spots that attract Violet's attention. Sophie has happy little squeaks that bring squeals of delight from Violet. She is able to make Sophie squeak and that brings much joy. Sophie's smooth skin is soothing to Violet's little gums. Sophie is 7 inches tall and is the exact correct size for babies to hold and love.As you well know the first thing babies grasp, goes into their mouths- how wonderful to have a toy that stimulates all of the senses and helps with the issue of teething. Sophie is small enough to fit into any size pocket or bag. Sophie is the perfect find for babies from a few months to a year old. How wonderful to hear the giggles and laughs that emanate from babies who find Sophie irresistible. Viva La Sophie!Highly Recommended.  prisrob 12-11-09\""

       "'My Mom-in-Law bought Sophie for my son when he was just starting to really chew on things (and we were hearing some pretty scary things about toys not made in the USA). She did some research and came across Sophie and we are so glad that she did! While Sophie doesn\\'t come from the USA, we love the fact that she is 100% safe and natural, and my son loves to play with her. I also love how soft Sophie is, my son tends to swing his toys around and when he\\'s sitting on my lap I\\'m usually in danger of being hit in the face with whatever he\\'s holding, needless to say a soft toy is even better in my book! There\\'s one last thing I want to comment on, I\\'ve read reviews that said that Sophie was a \"glorified dog toy\" or something to that effect, and I don\\'t want to seem rude, but I think they\\'re crazy! Yes Sophie does squeak, (which my son didn\\'t care about much at first but now he loves) but that\\'s about as far as the comparison could go! If you want a quality teething toy for your child then look no further! Sophie is adorable, soft, perfect for little hands, 100% natural, and SAFE!!!!!!! Definitely worth every penny!!'"

       "'I wanted to love this product and was excited to buy it when I became pregnant but am now hesitant to let my baby use it after reading about the recall in Europe. Apparently, as I understand it, their toxin standards of measurement are lower than ours so they have not been recalled here (apparently we are OK with low levels of nitrates in the toys our children put in their mouths, but Europeans are not...hmmm)...Be that as it may, toxins registering even CLOSE to a dangerous level made me nervous about using. After digging around online I did discover that the company claims to have changed the product after a certain date and lists manufacturing codes so you can check yours (those listed were made after a certain date and are said to be safer). Sadly mine was not made after the &#34;improved&#34; date but I could not return it because there was no formal recall in our country. I considered returning it and hunting for one with an approved manufacturing date but man that was just too much work. Bummed but not ready to take a risk with my baby.'"

       "\"I was so looking forward to getting this for my little girl, but from the second I opened the box I was disappointed.  It didn't smell like vanilla rubber; it smelled like latex.  I don't get HOW it can be called a teether.  It is a squeak toy.  Period.  It is completely hollow and has an obnoxious squeak when you barely even touch it.  It is so flexible that I don't see how a- it can be safe (which reading some of the other negative reviews I now see that it probably isn't safe) or b- can be effective.  This thing gives at the slightest touch, so how can it possibly aid in cutting teeth or massaging the gums?Additionally, you cannot sterilize this toy.  So... let's see.  My baby got thrush when she was only 2 weeks old and I had to sterilize everything that came in contact with her mouth.  What would I have done with this then?  And she just got over her first cold, so again everything was sterilized.  You need to sterilize things with a baby- you just do.  How can this be a toy that you can't sterilize?!?I will be going to Barnes and Noble tomorrow to compare and see if this is the same as what they have there, but either way I'm sorely disappointed in this purchase.  I've bought dog toys that would have made better teethers.  Heck, I have a baby Garanimals water toy giraffe that would be a safer and more effective teether.  **I have two other toys by Vulli and they DO HAVE the natural rubber smell.  This is going back to Amazon.**\""
