## Regression: Predicting House Price

One of the most widely used statistical tools.

The idea is really simple. Using some sets of **features**, model how the **observations** associated with these **features** change, as the values of the **features** change. In this case, house values.

A house have some set of features:
* Size of the house
* Number of bedrooms
* Number of bathrooms
* Etc.

The observation is what's the value of the house, or the house sales price.

But regression go much beyond doing prediction tasks. It can also used for classification, as well as analyze the importance of the features themselves.

## Predicting House Price

### How Much The House Worth?

### Check Recent Neighborhood Sales

### Plot Recent House Sales

### Predict House By Similar House

## Linear Regression

### Use Linear Regression Model

### Which Line?

### Cost Using Given Line

### Find Best Line

### Predict House Price

## Add Higher Order Effect

### Fit Data With Line?

### What About Quadratic Function?

### Even Higher Order Polynomial

### Believe This Fit?

## Evaluate Overfit Via Train / Test Split
